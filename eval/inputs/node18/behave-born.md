description: Children can be exhausting. While waiting for them to express their needs clearly with words, we can safely bet maybe they're amazed at our world.

Today I was listening to a French song I like called “Foule Sentimentale” (in English sentimental crowd). We are drawn to the stars that shine in the darkness. Yesterday I could observe the moon during the day.

In the song Alain Souchon mentions the fact that we are told not to be a jerk since day 1. And then children have a hard time with ridiculous demands. It’s as if you had called a lawyer to ask that your neighbours stop taking away your mind like the top of a tin.

Yes it’s a ridiculous demand to ask a child not to cry or not to whine or not to ask question. I’ve had my share of ridiculous demands to the point of having an early puberty.

Anyway as a reminder a jerk is an unreachable, stupid and naive person. Why don’t they kill the children before age 10 then? You also have to take into account that every generation needs to disobey when the rules seem strange.

## What’s Wrong With A Little Profit From Children?

In the past children were so exploited that Francoise Dolto said stop. We must listen to children who might have an innate sense of God’s mystery.

Why’s there blue sky? Why’s there red sky? I guess a child could be an answer to a lot of questions even though new questions might arise. But it seems there’s no mystery: there is too much testosterone down here.

Testosterone is the primary male sex hormone and an anabolic steroid. In male humans, testosterone plays a key role in the development of male reproductive tissues, as well as promoting secondary sexual characteristics.

This is a man’s world but it would be nothing without a woman’s arms. Estrogen, or oestrogen, is the primary female sex hormone. It is responsible for the development and regulation of the female reproductive system and secondary sex characteristics.

## What If Testing Was About Body Language?

Imagine a world without somatisation. Would we exist without somatisation? What kind of world would it be without a body responsible for protection, justification and elimination?

There must be some kind of way out of here said the body to the words. Children might do some somatisation sometimes if the words don’t come easy.

I was thinking that the words will find you in case there’s too much to say. But I think the secret relies on our body language. I thought our bodies was a kind of summary for others. I even thought your face could be linked to your identity (and then your front body) and your profile could be related to your journey.

Anyway, to conclude the paragraph, this is no mystery that too much testing isn’t a good idea (especially when things are wrong). We must find the fundamental bug quick because new ones will appear until we finally get it right.

## Two Big Problems Our Humanity Has To Deal With.

<aside class="md:-mr-56 md:float-right w-full md:w-2/3 md:px-8">

Humanity of course has to do some testing just in case. What if I don’t smoke and drink coffee today and I stay in bed? Will I get a heart attack? But I think here are the problems that will appear when we are finished with testing the water:
 - too much stimulation: who hadn’t had the fear of missing out (FOMO)? Lately Jordan Belfort was going to come to Beirut to explain how to sale anything to someone gullible enough. The guy has some points but I don’t want to be a wolf. I’m going to pass,
 - too much tribalism: in the 1970s we had a Golden Age of Tribes. Lasting around 15 years, it was my prenatal Chen and today my condition isn’t so great. We’re trying to send signals to our friends but our enemies have decoded the message. When you see someone smoking, think of a Native American making smoke signs.

Our humanity should be simple: we should spend most of our time resting instead of testing. What if tomorrow the trees wake up and they decide they will exploit our knowledge like a small child?

## Do You Smell Like A Teen Spirit?

As a conclusion, we all know children smell good. So how come do teenagers smell so bad? That’s because they are so vague that their emptiness could be related to the immensity of the universe.

The Smashing Pumpkins had an album called Melancholy and the Infinite Sadness (mellon collie to be precise). Are we there because a long time ago someone was bored to death and was looking for company?

Lately I let the child in me speak: I was thinking that the game of life could be to be the fastest to go back on the location of the Big Bang? Big rewards await there like 7 years of good luck and bad things in the past transformed into a nice song.

Now you know how I’m exploiting the child in me; as a result the dream is back and it’s the best way to motivate yourself. Will deviant people become the norm? Cool kids never have the time…

```
[Verse 1]
Shakedown 1979
Cool kids never have the time
On a live wire right up off the street
You and I should meet
Junebug skippin' like a stone
With the headlights pointed at the dawn
We were sure we'd never see an end
To it all

[Chorus]
And I don't even care
To shake these zipper blues
And we don't know
Just where our bones will rest
To dust I guess
Forgotten and absorbed
Into the earth below

[Verse 2]
Double-cross the vacant and the bored
They're not sure just what we have in store
Morphine city slippin' dues
Down to see

[Chorus 2]
That we don't even care
As restless as we are
We feel the pull
In the land of a thousand guilts
And poured cement

[Bridge]
Lamented and assured
To the lights and towns below
Faster than the speed of sound
Faster than we thought we'd go
Beneath the sound of hope

[Verse 3]
Justine never knew the rules
Hung down with the freaks and ghouls
No apologies ever need be made
I know you better than you fake it
To see

[Chorus 1]
That we don't even care
To shake these zipper blues
And we don't know
Just where our bones will rest
To dust I guess
Forgotten and absorbed
Into the earth below

[Outro]
The street heats the urgency of now
As you see there's no one around
```
