I love America. I love the music and I love the landscapes. I love how big it is and the population even though you can stumble sometimes upon someone in disgrace.

Lately I was reading a French magazine about America. The author of the article was very clear: no other empire has brought so much progress to the world. The author was going as far as saying that “the weird steps of America will be quickly forgotten”.

To me America feels like Europe from the Renaissance.

The Renaissance was a period in European history, covering the span between the 14th and 17th centuries and marking the transition from the Middle Ages to modernity. The traditional view focuses more on the early modern aspects of the Renaissance and argues that it was a break from the past, but many historians today focus more on its medieval aspects and argue that it was an extension of the Middle Ages.

The intellectual basis of the Renaissance was its version of humanism, derived from the concept of Roman Humanitas and the rediscovery of classical Greek philosophy, such as that of Protagoras, who said that “Man is the measure of all things.” This new thinking became manifest in art, architecture, politics, science and literature.

## Do You See The Empire By Looking At The Map?

I also read magazines about civilisations and history. My life has naturally brought me to contemplate the Byzantine and Persian empire. The territories of those empire were huge sometimes. You could say now the European Union is an empire.

The temptation of the empire always comes knocking at the door it seems.

Anyway, America and the United States made a difference with their music. They bet on music to have less violence instead of relying on teachers’ and the police’s brutality.

The power of music is a strange one: I wonder if some crimes against humanity couldn’t be exorcised with music. In case there are people who want to move on of course.

## Will America Help You Find Out Who You Are?

This song by James Brown mentions the fact that distances are short now in America. Thanks to the flying industry, station to station is very easy.

I know a country in the Middle East where distances are also short. Of course I’m talking about Lebanon, the creators of Europe and maybe America. Our Phoenician ancestors were the first to create an alphabet and they explored the Mediterranean sea.

If we want to succeed in the space race, then we will have to be skilled navigators and be as precise as possible. And that’s where vocabulary is interesting.

By the way, yesterday Ginger Baker died (Cream’s guitarist) and, like Jimi Hendrix, those 2 bands enriched the vocabulary of rock. This means we’re much more precise now. We’re going down, if that’s the only way to make this cruel, cruel world hear what we’ve got to say.

## Men On The Moon Will Make Us Want More.

President Kennedy had set a clear goal for America: land a man on the moon and return him safe. Of course, this is space related but I guess then it’s about something else. Something we all need in this cruel world: a risk free gamble.

Now imagine thanks to America we can travel space with no casualties. After all, you have to escape the Earth’s gravity and the atmosphere.

I guess it’s not enough to make the world safer. We need to make the world more space friendly. On this blog, each time I’m talking about space, I’m also talking about love.

I guess love is a walk down on Main Street. We need space travels to be like a gentle ballad. With the time it takes, we will have the opportunity to decode cosmik debris.

## Does America Have Something Up Its Colorful Sleeve?

As a conclusion, America believes in science and progress. But they also believe in music and that’s what made me an American although I don’t have the passport. I’m French and Lebanese but I could go live in America.

I mean don’t get me wrong: France and Lebanon are interesting countries as well but I feel the artists there lack some kind of realism. They lack a good producer who will know what kind of compromise to make so that you don’t sound like a nosebleed.

Yes I’m proud to renew my vows to America because the climate in Paris is a curiousity and the one in Lebanon is like an never ending investigation.

With America and their 2 weeks of holidays a year, we can expect to get rid of that strange thing that makes us stranded in the Earth’s jungle. Now I’m glad to announce that thanks to myself and my zero holidays since 2002, we managed to free humanity and we will reach the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world.

The invention of the alphabet was central in founding a stable humanity. Even musicians know they should enrich the vocabulary of their instrument.

[Verse 1: Prince]
I'm going down
To Alphabet Street
I'm gonna crown
The first girl that I meet
I'm gonna talk so sexy
She'll want me from my head to my feet

[Chorus: Prince and Background Vocalists]
(Yeah, yeah, yeah) Yes, she will
(Yeah, yeah, yeah) Yeah
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: Prince]
I'm gonna drive my daddy's Thunderbird
(My daddy's Thunderbird)
A white rad ride, '66 ('67)
So glam, it's absurd
I'm gonna put her in the back seat
And drive her to Tennessee

[Chorus: Prince and Background Vocalists]
(Yeah, yeah, yeah) Mmm-mmm
(Yeah, yeah, yeah) Tennessee
(Yeah, yeah, yeah) Drive her

[Verse 3: Prince]
Excuse me, baby
I don't mean to be rude
But I guess tonight, I'm just not
I'm just not in the mood
So if you don't mind (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I would like to watch

[Chorus: Prince and Background Vocalists]
(Yeah, yeah, yeah) Ow!
(Yeah, yeah, yeah) Ow!
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme

[Verse 4: Prince and Background Vocalists]
We're going down, down, down
If that's the only way
To make this cruel, cruel world
Hear what we've got to say
Put the right letters together
And make a better day

[Chorus: Prince and Background Vocalists]
(Yeah, yeah, yeah) Better days
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Baby, it's the only way
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 5: Prince and Background Vocalists]
Cat, we need you to rap
Cat, we need you to rap
Don't give it to us slow
'Cause if we know, you know
New Power Soul
Got to, got to, got to go!

[Verse 6: Cat Glover and Prince]
Talk to me, lover
Come on, tell me what you taste
Didn't your mama tell you
Life is too good to waste? (Put your love down)
Did she tell you Lovesexy
Was the glam of them all?
You can hang, you can trip on it
You surely won't fall (Put your love down)
No side effects, the feeling lasts forever
Straight up, it tastes good
It makes you feel clever (Put your love down)
You kiss your enemies
Like you know you should
Then you jerk your body like
A horny pony would (Put your love down)
You jerk your body like
A horny pony would
Now run and tell your mama about that!
And while you're at it
Tell your papa about this!

[Interlude: Prince]
Put your love down there
When you wanna get shot
Put your love down there
When you wanna get shot
Put your love down there
When you wanna get shot
Put your love down there
When you wanna get shot
Put your love down there

[Outro: Prince, Background Vocalists, & Shelia E.]
Yeah! Ho! Alphabet Street
L-Love, L-Love
L-Love, L-Love
L-Love, L-Love
L-Love, L-Love, Lovesexy
Yeah! Ho! Alphabet Street
Yeah! Ho! Alphabet Street
A, B, C, D, E, F, H
I love you
