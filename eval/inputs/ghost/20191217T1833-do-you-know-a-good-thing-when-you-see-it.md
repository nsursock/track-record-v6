Today I want to talk about development hell. Because life is kind of random, we have to embrace the fact our ideas are fragile at first, and if we don’t give them some attention, they will die quickly. This idea from Steve Jobs makes a lot of sense.

Today the idea I’m thinking of is development hell and a movie called Random Hearts (with Harrison Ford and Christine Scott-Thomas). Critics deemed the film exciting, but they said that, with one more rewrite, it could have been excellent.

Lately, I wanted to write an autobiography. I’m writing, and I don’t like rewriting even though it seems it’s the daily grind of writers. After all, I composed several songs a long time ago, and I revisited them several years later. I’m so happy with the results today, even though it still sounds a bit like a video game.

What about writer’s block then? A kind of shock that makes you feel like a butterfly in a hurricane. Suddenly, you’re loving drugs.

## Is Forgetting A Problem The Only Way To Solve It?

They say you have to forget a problem and then the solution will appear like an illumination. The light will allow you to distinguish all the beautiful things laid upon the table.

A bad obsession is like a prison. Space agencies might be able to explain to us what it’s all about. It’s been 7 million years, and we’re still stuck on Earth. We’re still in a kind of beatitude with that dark sky that promised us a lot of beautiful oases.

If we forget about space, then we will find a way to travel easily that infinite place. Ok, it might not be infinite (the edge of the observable universe is 46 billion light-years). Recently, I thought humanity wasn’t insignificant but only represented 1% of all living things in the world.

This makes us a minority, and that might be why we’re in a ghetto on Earth. It’s indeed an awesome ghetto with magnificent landscape, though.

## Is The Ancienty Of Your Broken Heart Important?

Sometimes I’m surprised to think that ancienty and anxiety sound the same. How old are you, and why is it important? Is it because we all know the end of the story? What I mean is that today our life expectancy is around 80 years old.

Who wants to live forever? Does this world have only one sweet moment? There can be only one winner, and, for some of us, participating is not enough.

I’m 39 years old, and my heart was broken when I was 14 years old. Like most of us, though. But I blew all other witches on the scene.

How long is your bullwhip? A Lebanese American author mentioned the fact that today we have more slaves than in Antiquity. This is the opinion of Nassim Nicholas Taleb.

## Is A Good Thing Something You Can Measure?

Skin in the Game: Hidden Asymmetries in Daily Life is a 2018 nonfiction book by Nassim Nicholas Taleb, a former options trader with a background in the mathematics of probability and statistics.

Taleb’s thesis is that skin in the game — i.e., having a measurable risk when taking a significant decision — is necessary.

Options give you the right but not the obligation. Lately, I was thinking that God might be an options trader. Options are so flexible that it’s a helpful strategy when you feel life is chaotic and random.

I’ve been evaluating my prejudice for 9 years now, and it amounts to at least 25 million dollars. I was born in Torment 16 with statistics of the order of billions, and I shouldn’t be too afraid to face those 25 million.

## What If We Spent Our Time Evaluating The Debt?

In the end, is it a good thing to spend your life evaluating the debt while most people will deem the situation bright and exciting? I like to do some private investigations. Still, I didn’t imagine there would be an investigation of the detective in me.

I have to dig up the dirt even though you can meet all sorts in this line of work. Treachery and treason, there’s always a good excuse for it.

I know a terrible thing when I see it, and it’s a good thing to talk about it. People with PTSD have a hard time communicating on an experience. But I guess I have a standard procedure for any kind of trauma: what can you say when a love affair is over?

We don’t know how long love will last, but there’s only one thing I’m sure of: now’s the time to be strong (like every day).
