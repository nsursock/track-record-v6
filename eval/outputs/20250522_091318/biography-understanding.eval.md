### **Overall: 3.6/5‚≠ê**

This essay is thoughtful and original, with moments of genuine insight and vulnerability. Its strengths lie in its inventive metaphors and personal voice, but it would benefit from greater clarity, depth, and practical focus.

**Contextual Summary:**
In the tradition of essays that blend personal narrative with historical and cultural critique, this piece aspires to the style of writers like Oliver Sacks or Rebecca Solnit, though it does not yet reach their level of rigor or insight. To elevate the work, the author should focus on deepening the analysis, clarifying the argument, and offering more concrete guidance to the reader. The piece has the potential to resonate with a broad audience, but only if it is sharpened and grounded in revision.
