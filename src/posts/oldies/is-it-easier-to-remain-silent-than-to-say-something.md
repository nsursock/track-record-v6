Do we remain silent because there's too much to say? And is it easier to remain silent than to say something? What can you say since the Beirut blast?

I'm making a big effort to write 3 pages today on the dodgy subject of silence. Maybe there's the silence so you won't disturb anybody? Maybe you don't know how to talk and all you can utter are onomatopoeias.

In any case, we will see that speaking requires real courage. Words don't come easy sometimes. And when you speak you take the risk of saying something stupid.

That's why blogging is a courageous endeavor. It takes hard work not to sound like a moron every day. I hope today I won't write too much bullshit because it takes a big effort to work after the Beirut blast.

## Do You Remain Silent Because Of Depression?

My words won't come outright. Maybe people who are silent are depressive. It's a hint one can't bypass. When you have a hard time expressing yourself, it becomes harder and harder for people to communicate with you.

When you are depressive, for sure, your communication will suffer. Nobody likes someone who brings everybody down.

So maybe you remain silent in order to comfort people? Because if you said something, someone might get hurt.

You enjoy the silence and feelings are intense and words are trivial. Words can only do harm in some cases. For example, during a summer day, do you need to talk?

## Do You Remain Silent Because There's Too Much To Say?

Sometimes you remain silent because if you start speaking it could take hours. Who likes to listen to someone for hours without being able to respond?

I know I'm talking a lot on that blog but there's a comment section. That way if you need to say something you can.

There are not many comments on that blog but I have to have visitors. The last comment I had was: "awesome post, keep up the good work." But lately, I didn't have the knack anymore.

The Beirut blast came as a warning: you could also have a mishap or failure. Bin Laden has killed 3,000 people in 2001 and coronavirus already killed 800,000 worldwide.

## Do You Remain Silent Because You Don't Want To Disturb?

You have the right to remain silent. Because otherwise, your words might disturb me a little. And that may be why there aren't many comments on this website.

Please leave a comment and rest assured I'm reading everything. People need feedback in life. Silence is a strong reply. Maybe time has played a trick on you and you remain silent with the years passing by.

With time, you don't want to disturb your loved ones. Maybe they had some bad luck and you want to remain polite. Silence is a strong reply indeed.

## Do You Remain Silent Because You Must Invent Words?

If all you can say is "ha!", "hey!" and "ho!" then maybe it's time considering inventing new words. Lately, I tried to do that but I don't know if I was successful.

There's something fun about inventing new words. It takes a lot of creativity and credibility to make them sound original. Let's try to invent a word today: sganarel. This means "I'm worried all the time the pain won't go away."

Let's try to invent another one: supeflip. It means "I wonder what will happen next after a bad year like this one." 2020 has been one of the worst years of my life and I've had some in the past.

## Do You Remain Silent Because You're Paranoid?

Overall, you might be silent because you're paranoid. Anything you say can be held against you. Sometimes I wonder if my blog doesn't have too much violence. Of course, I have a very violent life and the Beirut blast is the icing on the cake.

During the 1st decade of the 21st century, I participated successfully in the War on Terror launched by George W Bush. I was central and I had control but now I lost my head. That's because someone owes me a big amount of money and didn't pay me yet.

I'm writing to the President from the beginning of the year. Words come easy and it's no surprise. What works well is clearly stated.

So maybe you remain silent because something is too blurry to be clearly stated. Yes, the more I think about it, the more it makes sense. You remain silent because your mind isn't at peace.

How come you have no problem ordering a coffee or a pizza? What if we remained silent in front of the employee? Wouldn't he be bored?
