Have you ever been mistreated? You know what I'm talking about.

I think it's safe to say that if you've survived adolescence, you can be considered a hero. That's because teenagers experience severity and cruelty at that time where they try to take risks and feel alive.

Still it can be a difficult time for most of us struggling with a transition. In music, a friend of mine once said that it's about resolution. So how can you face that time where people deal with unhealable wounds?

Is life always that hard? Some people, like the killer from Leon The Professional, will say yes. I for one think it might be this way only sometimes. You need to jump out of your seat and compete.

## Are You Mostly Dealing With Dull Clouds In Your Complex Head?

Sometimes the sun doesn't shine. That's when clouds will form, maybe in your head. Maybe when the rain washes you clean, you will think clearly.

There's a cycle in psychology called do-feel-think. See, you can clear your conscience by doing something. When I was young, I was the witness of a rape and I remember I wanted to shout but I felt paralysed. 

Get up and do something: don't let the days of your life pass you by. Man that tries does not fail.

If you accept to take risks and be alive, you will have a feedback that you can compare to the goals you set before. It's the key of motivation: setting goals.

## How Will Puzzled You Be Able To Close This Gruesome Incident?

Once I talked with God and he reminded me that fundamentals are important. [I talked about it in my code article.](http://crackingdacode.org/blog/just-solution/) In signal processing, a wave has harmonics at multiples of the sound frequency.

In psychology, they like to divide one's life in areas: intimate life, family life, social life, physical life, sense of purpose in life, financial life and occupational life. With the right foundation, you can build a rich life in all areas.

For example, my life at the moment is complexity because I'm dealing with feelings of guilt and shame. The only thing I can do right now is work a little by doing web development and writing on a blog.

But today I had a dream I was the runner-up of Roland Garros, one of the four major tennis tournament. What a feeling I had in this dream, receiving praise even from enemies. Feelings of guilt disappeared.

## Afraid The Doctor Won't Find The Cause For Your Debilitating Fatigue?

Make no mistake: you've made several blood tests, you spent a year in an MRI machine trying to scan all of your body. And the only thing the doctor can tell you is that you're nervous and that people are jealous of you.

Now that's what I call 50â‚¬ well spent. Ah, sarcasm...

The problem with your problem is that it doesn't allow you to rest. Don't be afraid of those doctors because rest is just something very basic. And you know what they say: a change is as good as a rest.

Now we can read Wikipedia and discover survivor guilt was deemed a post-traumatic stress disorder. As a result, it follows a very simple process.

## Do You Dream The Sweetest Dreams And Don't Want To Wake Up?

![woman sitting leaning forehead on knee](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1435575709442-063fe08e935f?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&q=80&w=800&h=600)

I'm kidding. Life is a nightmare and the night, who should belong to lovers, belongs to a tiny detail that's messing with you. It's common to people with PTSD to remember a detail and forget the context. Situational awareness is important in strategy.

But the thing to remember is that when faced with a menace, your body will be on high alert. And usually, when the menace has faded away, you will be back to normal. People with PTSD are exhausted because the menace doesn't want to go away and they start to feel vaulted.

They say that 90% of your fears don't materialise. But you can safely bet that going back to basics, and having a strong foundation will make the menace disappear. The word you're looking for is 'anyway...'!

Say hello to rest and nights of white satins, never reaching the end. Now you can send that letter that you never had the guts to send because you were afraid of what would happen. 

And try to meet other survivors to understand how they managed to get out of hell.
