There's an old saying: "When you get back on your feet again, everybody wants to be your long lost friend." It captures something fundamental about human nature that I've been wrestling with my entire life - the way people position themselves around success and failure, light and darkness.

If you've ever felt disgusted with life, you're not alone. What I've learned through years of observation and personal struggle is that people have an innate drive to shine. But here's the paradox: to truly shine, you need to be surrounded by darkness. Life, in its cruel wisdom, provides plenty of that darkness. The question is whether you become the light or get consumed by the shadows.

The harsh reality is that in this eternal game of human ambition, there's often collateral damage. People become victims - not by choice, but by circumstance. I know this intimately because at age three, I couldn't sleep due to bombardments echoing through the night. That experience taught me early that life isn't a gentle teacher; it's more like a strict school where lessons come through pain and the curriculum is written in survival.

## The Psychology of Shining: Why We Create Victims

The drive to shine isn't inherently evil - it's human nature. But understanding this drive helps explain why some people end up as victims of others' ambitions. Consider Zinedine Zidane, arguably the greatest soccer player ever. He once revealed that his childhood friends were equally talented, but he was the only one serious enough to pursue greatness. This illustrates a crucial point: shining requires more than talent; it demands unwavering commitment.

However, this pursuit of excellence often comes at a cost to others. When someone is determined to rise above, they inevitably cast shadows. Those caught in these shadows - whether through circumstance, timing, or simply being in the wrong place - become the unintended victims of another's ascent.

Take the tech industry as a modern example. When Amazon expanded aggressively, thousands of small bookstores closed. Jeff Bezos wasn't trying to hurt local business owners, but his drive to revolutionize commerce created victims nonetheless. The bookstore owners who lost their livelihoods weren't failures - they were casualties of someone else's vision.

The key insight here is that being a victim isn't always about personal failure. Sometimes it's about being caught in the crossfire of someone else's ambition. The challenge is recognizing when you're in this position and choosing how to respond.

Tim Duncan, known as "Mr. Fundamentals" in basketball, built his success on a strong foundation rather than flashy moves. His approach offers a different model: you can shine through consistency and depth rather than by dimming others' lights. This suggests that the victim-creator dynamic isn't inevitable - it's a choice in how we pursue our goals.

## Reading the Signs: When You're Caught in the Middle

![person with red and white floral nail art](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1599035465882-019b64e268a2?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&q=80&w=800&h=600)

We're all searching for clues about our place in the world, examining the lines in our palms as if they hold answers. When you find yourself in darkness - whether emotional, social, or circumstantial - your heart often knows the way forward before your mind does.

My own experience illustrates this complexity. I found myself standing in the crossfire of the war on terror, a conflict that shaped my understanding of violence and survival. While some might consider it a privilege to have participated in history and emerged victorious, the psychological cost was immense. The fog of war doesn't just affect soldiers on battlefields; it invades the minds of anyone touched by extreme conflict.

This experience taught me that intense emotions are layered and complex. The rage I sometimes feel isn't simple anger - it's a cocktail of survivor guilt, the frustration of being misunderstood, and the weight of carrying experiences that others can't comprehend. It raises a haunting question: must we suffer or die to be truly understood or valued?

The trauma of war becomes the foundation of your worldview, coloring every subsequent interaction. When your baseline is extreme violence and aggression, normal social dynamics feel foreign and often threatening. This creates a perpetual state of being caught in the middle - too damaged for civilian life, too civilian for military understanding.

Consider how this plays out in everyday situations. A veteran returns home and struggles to relate to complaints about traffic jams or slow WiFi. Their friends can't understand why they seem distant or irritable. Neither side is wrong, but both become victims of a gap that trauma creates. The veteran feels isolated; the friends feel rejected. Everyone loses.

## Breaking the Cycle: Refusing to Be a Perpetual Victim

The pattern repeats endlessly: people want to shine, and they judge you by the company you keep. I've experienced this firsthand when someone blocked me on social media despite never having interacted with them directly. Their decision was based purely on association - guilt by proximity in the digital age.

But here's the crucial realization: you don't have to remain a victim forever. When the main entrance is closed, you can find the back door. This isn't about deception; it's about adaptability and refusing to let others' need to shine permanently dim your own light.

The key is simplicity and persistence. I often wonder why I continue pursuing understanding in what feels like a ravenous world - a place where people's basic needs (like reliable electricity in Lebanon) go unmet while governments fail their citizens. Yet this very persistence might be the answer.

People are obsessed with finding love and maintaining positive attitudes, but often all they can see is red - anger, frustration, disappointment. The challenge is learning to see the light that surrounds you even when circumstances make it difficult. This requires the strong foundation that champions like Tim Duncan understood: success built on fundamentals rather than flash.

Here are three practical strategies I've learned for breaking the victim cycle:

**1. Reframe Your Position**: Instead of seeing yourself as trapped between opposing forces, view your middle position as a unique vantage point. You can see what others miss.

**2. Build Bridges, Don't Burn Them**: When someone tries to diminish your light, resist the urge to retaliate. Instead, find ways to create mutual benefit.

**3. Document Your Journey**: Keep a record of your experiences and insights. This creates a resource for others facing similar challenges and helps you see your own progress.

## Information as Liberation: Understanding the Game

The ultimate weapon against being a perpetual victim is information. When lessons aren't clear, when you're struggling to understand why you're stuck in the middle, gathering information becomes critical for survival and growth.

Information liberates us from the victim mindset in several ways:

**Pattern Recognition**: When you understand the psychological patterns behind human behavior, you stop taking things personally. That person who blocked you on social media? They're probably protecting their own fragile sense of identity, not making a judgment about your worth.

**Strategic Thinking**: Information helps you see the bigger picture. Instead of reacting emotionally to each slight or setback, you can develop longer-term strategies for achieving your goals.

**Empathy Development**: The more you understand about human psychology and motivation, the more compassionate you become. This doesn't mean accepting abuse, but it does mean responding from a place of understanding rather than reactive anger.

Throughout my life, people have made predictions about me that seemed impossible. Like telling me I would experience significant personal growth when I felt completely stuck. Initially, this seemed absurd. But I've learned that people experiencing intense emotions, particularly those who've survived trauma, can sometimes achieve breakthroughs that defy conventional expectations.

This insight reveals something profound about human potential: we're often capable of more than we realize, especially when driven by powerful emotions. The key is channeling these emotions constructively rather than destructively.

My approach has been to try understanding people's motivations - getting into their heads to comprehend their actions. What I've consistently found is that universal drive to shine. Once you understand this fundamental human motivation, you can better navigate the complex social dynamics that often leave people feeling victimized.

The goal isn't to eliminate the desire to shine - that's impossible and probably undesirable. Instead, it's about creating space for multiple people to shine simultaneously, reducing the zero-sum thinking that creates victims in the first place.

## Finding Your Place in the Middle: A Call to Action

Being begrudgingly stuck in the middle isn't necessarily a permanent condition - it can be a vantage point. From the middle, you can see both sides, understand multiple perspectives, and potentially bridge divides that others can't.

The trauma of war, the experience of being misunderstood, the frustration of watching others succeed while you struggle - these experiences, while painful, provide unique insights into human nature. They teach you that everyone is fighting battles others can't see, that the drive to shine often masks deep insecurities, and that true strength comes from understanding rather than dominating.

But understanding alone isn't enough. You must act on these insights.

**Start small**: Choose one relationship where you feel stuck in the middle. Instead of waiting for the other person to change, take the first step toward understanding their perspective.

**Share your story**: Your experience of being caught in the crossfire has value. Others are struggling with similar feelings of being trapped between opposing forces. Your insights could be their liberation.

**Create rather than consume**: Instead of being a victim of others' ambitions, become a creator of opportunities. Use your unique position to build bridges, solve problems, and illuminate paths that others can't see.

**Practice radical acceptance**: Accept that some people will always see you as a threat to their shine. This isn't about you - it's about their insecurity. Your job isn't to dim your light to make them comfortable.

The choice is yours: remain a victim of circumstances and others' ambitions, or use your position in the middle as a platform for a different kind of shining. One that illuminates rather than casts shadows. One that lifts others rather than diminishing them.

In the end, perhaps being stuck in the middle isn't about being trapped between opposing forces. Perhaps it's about finding the balance point where you can shine without creating victims. Where you can succeed without requiring others to fail. 

That might be the most revolutionary act of all.

And it starts with you. Today. Right now.

What will you choose?
