Yesterday I noticed an advert for Jordan Belfort. You know it's this guy depicted on "The Wolf of Wall Street" by Leonardo DiCaprio. It's the guy who had a woman but could only last 5 minutes in bed. I must say Margot Robbie is terrific in this movie.

Anyway, Belfort is coming to Beirut, and we should get a ticket now because it's going to sell very quickly. We can also have a 50% coupon to save some money. Needless to say, that didn't work on me, and I'm going to explain why.

The Wolf of Wall Street is a 2013 American biographical black comedy crime film directed by Martin Scorsese and written by Terence Winter, based on the memoir of the same name by Jordan Belfort. It recounts Belfort's perspective on his career as a stockbroker in New York City and how his firm, Stratton Oakmont, engaged in rampant corruption and fraud on Wall Street, which ultimately led to his downfall.

Why would someone who was involved in corruption and fraud come to Beirut to make motivational speeches? But first, let's see if the event's website is not full of tears. After all, people have got to sell, and they like to do it.

People respect a man that tries. Should you fail elegantly, or does really "man that tries doesn't fail?"

## Should This Method Wear A Big Warning?

When you get on the event's website, you're quickly struck by the head of Jordan Belfort. Mixing contempt with being the inverse of a mother fucker, you can tell this guy is trying.

Still, he wonders if there shouldn't be a warning to his miracle recipes.

For example, he will explain how to make a sale and close anyone. But the person should be closable. Of course, this implies that some people scream NO with their body language, and it's no use selling them something.

You can only sell something to someone who is closable otherwise go back home and watch a movie. To me, sales are effortless, and you can have two helpful hints about closing.

If you read this blog and engage with it, you will have a solution to all your trouble. But this only works if it's past 6pm and the moon is in a waxing crescent. Now you reached for the secret: do you know a method where there's no BUT?

## Is The Bottom Line How It Can Get Pretty Strange?

![woman with gold-framed eyeglasses](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1544390951-7b9e6547fb28?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&q=80&w=800&h=600)

Before I explain what's my point of view on sales, let's go back to Belfort's website. In a New York minute, things can get pretty strange: you're trying to read a testimonial that's a bit long, but you only get 3 seconds to read it.

And that's how Jordan Belfort might be in trouble.

A few years ago, I tried to attend business school. I passed all the tests, but there was something that wasn't good enough. In their own words, it was eliminatory. Like a dog without a bone and an actor out on loan.

Now we should know what's the time in New York. In Beirut, time passes quickly sometimes and very slowly suddenly. Usually, when you feel like this, you forgot life might be a game.

Anyway if you want to make a sale, make sure there's not something eliminatory in your experience. But Belfort's totem animal should remind us what's his special technic.

Things can get pretty strange in a very short time. You'd better try to get in the head of your audience or prospect. As a bonus, if you succeed, you can for sure work in criminology.

## Should You Cite A Confidential Artist To Sell?

![man in black and white sweater standing beside wall with graffiti](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1628359355624-855775b5c9c4?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&q=80&w=800&h=600)

Once I met a salesman. I was a fresh consultant entering the workforce. I was struck by what the sales manager immediately said: "choosing implies giving up." Since I'm 18 years old, I liked philosophy a lot.

But I chose to listen to songs even though I enjoy a book from time to time.

To make sales and be a closer, you have to take into account 2 things:
 - People will find you weird trying to sell them something,
 - The only way out is a genuine touch of philosophy.

I'm not talking about stupid philosophy stating disillusion like the quote above. If I choose water over wine, why can't I drink wine in the evening or maybe beer? If philosophy is a crest road between 2 extremes, then maybe make sure to remind your prospect he will be one of the cool kids if he/she buys from you.

For your records, a cool kid never has the time. If you have time for Jordan Belfort and his interesting method yet lacking credibility, make sure to criticize. I can guarantee you it won't get worse than this (marketing bottom!)

## Is This Event The Last Chance To Stay Alive?

![metallic triangle](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1662072629492-b86a9d8e16b6?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&q=80&w=800&h=600)

In conclusion, this event from Jordan Belfort feels like the next whiskey bar: if it's not a success, we must die. The explicit mention that a sale strategy can fail because your prospect is not closable should make you wonder.

Lately, there was some publicity for a guy called Sabry Suby. His book "Sell Like Crazy" was advertised this way: "get as many customers as you can handle."

While I saw the advert every day, I didn't think this guy was crap like Belfort. Jordan is using old marketing techniques, and I sometimes wonder if marketing is not dead.

I guess The Eagles are right: your perception of time is essential, and things can get pretty strange very quickly. I didn't take any holidays for 18 years now, but I think my memory is playing tricks on me. What I'm trying to sell on that blog is the following: let's prevent war, rape, and murders with music education.

Here's the link to the event if you want to spend 2 days in Beirut. But make sure to visit Beirut and avoid this old school "sell like crazy" scheme. "It's going to sell very quickly, so make sure to buy tickets now." What's new under the sun of marketing?
