title: Is Magic About Taking Care Of Teeth And Nails?

Today I read an article by the New Yorker talking about witches. I know a lot about witches, and that's why I'm going to cite several songs that mention that special magic. I'm talking about teeth and nails. Witchcraft is about a small detail that can make a big difference.

For example, take that blog and how I try to motivate people to work with me. I propose a fixed salary, but this isn't enough. I want my traffic to increase and decided my coworkers will get a bonus based on the traffic this blog receives.

I'm surprised sometimes to notice the money I should have made in a perfect world. In practice, there's the dreaded funnel where you lose people in stages. But have no worries, I'm working on it. In a previous post, I was mentioning how a funnel could mean people think you're a joke.

The magic happens with small details, but it only happens outside of your comfort zone. And now, let's explore what music has to say about magic and witchcraft.

## Was It A Problem Of Consciousness And Critics?

The first song about witches is from Redbone. The song mentions the witch was living in a world of zombie voodoo. We all know what a zombie is.

To be more precise, this is what a philosophical zombie is. It's indistinguishable from a normal human being but lacks conscious experience, qualia, or sentience. Recently I was explaining what consciousness was about.

You have to express some critic when you discover the world or face a new experience. For example, this blog seldom has comments. I was a bit depressed, but I went through my record collection, and I understood why. There's too much to say (like a summer day).

Witches exist because of critical consciousness. One can think bad magic can happen because of an awful critic. Is there a special time for witchcraft, or can it happen anytime, anywhere?

## An Energetic Performance At The Players Choice.

The second song (by Jimi Hendrix) explains that witches can appear when someone got a bullwhip as long as your life. Of course, that person will turn you into a block of ice after saying "no" a thousand times.

The witch likes children, but they don't like men even though they need them for procreation. It sounds kind of weird how the world evolved. As Jamiroquai would say: every mother can choose the color of her child. Is it nature's way?

Relationships between men and women are complicated, but I have a hint about it. It would help if you had a standard of performance so that you are seldom disappointed. With time, every day can become a disappointment, and this is where Jesus must do miracles.

Witchcraft can happen after too much messing up someone. We can see witches want a lover at all costs.

## The Devil's Bed Was Her Confidential Destiny.

Julia Roberts would agree in this paragraph. Sleeping with the Enemy is a 1991 American neo-noir romantic psychological thriller film directed by Joseph Ruben and starring Julia Roberts, Patrick Bergin, and Kevin Anderson. The film is based on Nancy Price's 1987 novel of the same name.

Roberts plays a woman who escapes from her abusive husband, from Cape Cod to Cedar Falls, Iowa, where she captures the attention of a kindly college drama teacher.

Witches try to escape abusive people, but the memory of the night in Tunisia still lingers on. For example, there was an unsolvable problem, and you had to go back to school even though you were above 23 yo.

Sleeping with the enemy can happen, but I guess the challenge is to understand the abuse. But does thunder only occur when it's raining?

## What Kind Of Violence To Wake Up Authorities?

The police and security will come: sorry there's no skating here. We all know what it was all about with witches and the donor boys. People need someone to be theirs and have a problem with propriety.

Bob Dylan had a song about appreciating instead of dominating. Witches have a hard time understanding, and they want to dominate. Women want to take power back, but men also have something to say.

When it comes to power, there's only one way to rock: determine the weak point and attack from here. That's because you want to create a lot of headaches and put a lot of pressure on your opponents.

As a conclusion, you could say witchcraft is about details like teeth and nails. You know the idiom, don't you? "The devil is in the detail" is an idiom that refers to a catch or mysterious element hidden in the details.

I must say I'm tired of getting out of my comfort zone. Or I'm comfortable, and I lack consciousness. In any case, feel free to leave a comment below and explain your point of view on sorcery.
