### Introduction

The catastrophic explosion in Beirut left the city devastated, both physically and psychologically. For many survivors, including myself, the repercussions linger long after the physical rubble was cleared. The days since the Beirut blast have been marked by a pervasive sense of powerlessness, emotional turmoil, and persistent anxiety. In this article, I reflect on the mental health implications of the event, my own struggles, and the broader context of trauma and recovery.

## Living with Survivor’s Guilt

![An individual looking somber, reflecting alone, with faint images of others in the background.](https://oaidalleapiprodscus.blob.core.windows.net/private/org-5JJ8aWH7HYWySPOfcWeXFaip/user-yP0O54fRxuFGq1kcxDqpfG1J/img-mLf9iIRauYdMZZu2uI7tA6yK.png?st=2025-05-08T02%3A27%3A53Z&se=2025-05-08T04%3A27%3A53Z&sp=r&sv=2024-08-04&sr=b&rscd=inline&rsct=image/png&skoid=cc612491-d948-4d2e-9821-2683df3719f5&sktid=a48cca56-e6da-484e-a814-9c849652bcb3&skt=2025-05-07T22%3A59%3A53Z&ske=2025-05-08T22%3A59%3A53Z&sks=b&skv=2024-08-04&sig=JxNdaDqb1cvGtBeV8nzCCVSbOOvNz8bnOyMtcPWRoho%3D)


### Defining Survivor’s Guilt

Survivor’s guilt is a psychological condition that arises when someone survives a traumatic event while others do not. The individual may feel that their survival is unjust or undeserved, leading to persistent feelings of guilt and shame. This response often includes intrusive thoughts about what might have been, and a questioning of one’s own actions or luck.

### Emotional Consequences

Living with overwhelming guilt and shame can make everyday life unbearable. These powerful emotions can lead to a state of misery if left unaddressed. The legendary musician Eric Clapton, for example, was so moved by these struggles in his own life and the lives of others that he founded a rehabilitation center specifically aimed at aiding individuals grappling with such deep-seated guilt and shame. This highlights the seriousness and universality of survivor’s guilt across different backgrounds and professions.

### Manifestations in Daily Life

Since the Beirut explosion, I have noticed drastic changes in my disposition and behavior. There are moments when I feel like I have lost a crucial part of myself, as if I am no longer the capable person I used to be. Even in simple routines, such as maintaining a regular blogging schedule, the debilitating effects of guilt and unresolved trauma have become apparent. What was once a daily habit has become a significant challenge.

### The Age of Trauma

It seems, at a certain point in life, virtually everyone comes to know trauma. Most people endure at least one impactful event after reaching adolescence. This shared experience unfortunately binds us, but it can also be a source of empathy and collective healing. However, when trauma transforms into lingering survivor’s guilt and self-reproach, the pain can become unbearable, at times leading to thoughts of self-harm or despair.

## The Challenge of Concentration After Trauma

![Illustration of a distressed person struggling to focus, surrounded by chaotic, overwhelming imagery.](https://oaidalleapiprodscus.blob.core.windows.net/private/org-5JJ8aWH7HYWySPOfcWeXFaip/user-yP0O54fRxuFGq1kcxDqpfG1J/img-P2PqMI60ifQ6hmG6ngYEGVnM.png?st=2025-05-08T02%3A28%3A13Z&se=2025-05-08T04%3A28%3A13Z&sp=r&sv=2024-08-04&sr=b&rscd=inline&rsct=image/png&skoid=cc612491-d948-4d2e-9821-2683df3719f5&sktid=a48cca56-e6da-484e-a814-9c849652bcb3&skt=2025-05-07T21%3A56%3A26Z&ske=2025-05-08T21%3A56%3A26Z&sks=b&skv=2024-08-04&sig=j87amm9TH9ryydCVrx9pObysQt%2BYKUUhj0zB8hnkrX8%3D)


### Aggravation of Symptoms

The psychological aftermath of the Beirut explosion has compounded symptoms I was already managing. For the past two years, I had been navigating feelings of unease and uncertainty while writing this blog. However, post-blast, even constructing coherent sentences has felt like a monumental task. My motivation and clarity have waned, and consistency in blogging has become elusive.

### Looking Back on Efforts

Despite these struggles, I managed to publish 300 blog posts over two years. This achievement brings a sense of pride, even if I believe only a fraction of these entries offer substantial value. My perspective is that productivity and completion — “done is better than perfect” — are preferable to paralysis by perfectionism, especially when writing serves as both dialogue and introspection.

### Intrusion of the Past

Trauma often causes the past to bleed into the present. Old memories can become intrusive, manifesting as anger or nervousness. As a result, I find myself dwelling on regrets and painful events, rather than embracing the present moment. While this is a common response to trauma, it disrupts daily functioning and makes it increasingly difficult to focus even on life’s most basic tasks.

### The Intersection of Personal and Global Concerns

My struggles with concentration are compounded by personal disappointments, such as the failures of past relationships and the profound effect these have had on other life domains. The complex tapestry of personal sorrow and global crisis, including ongoing geopolitical instability, works synergistically to undermine psychological resilience.

## The Inescapability of Traumatic Memories

![A person sits alone, head in hands, surrounded by haunting images of the Beirut blast.](https://oaidalleapiprodscus.blob.core.windows.net/private/org-5JJ8aWH7HYWySPOfcWeXFaip/user-yP0O54fRxuFGq1kcxDqpfG1J/img-fQPBFUXcIeaAbxj16xoECNWD.png?st=2025-05-08T02%3A28%3A34Z&se=2025-05-08T04%3A28%3A34Z&sp=r&sv=2024-08-04&sr=b&rscd=inline&rsct=image/png&skoid=cc612491-d948-4d2e-9821-2683df3719f5&sktid=a48cca56-e6da-484e-a814-9c849652bcb3&skt=2025-05-07T21%3A56%3A24Z&ske=2025-05-08T21%3A56%3A24Z&sks=b&skv=2024-08-04&sig=FCJCYXNl9FTdP0/EHsijaDVBd46eAmF/Zzp1bpPoXd8%3D)


### Persistent Obsession

Following the Beirut blast, my thoughts have been consumed by the event itself. It has become nearly impossible to direct my attention elsewhere. Questions linger: Was the survival of my loved ones and myself the result of fortune, or a twist of fate? Regardless, our empathy for those who lost so much remains profound, intensifying the sense of collective bereavement.

### Unfathomable Negligence

A central source of obsession is the sheer magnitude of negligence involved in storing such large quantities of explosives near a densely populated area. The tragedy feels both horrifying and senseless, leaving survivors haunted by questions of responsibility, accountability, and the prevention of future disasters.

### The Global Emotional Response

The blast resonated far beyond Lebanon’s borders. In the aftermath, friends and communities around the world reached out in solidarity. While some sense of support was comforting, the overwhelming feeling remained one of confusion and overwhelm. Trauma, it seems, can take control of one’s mind, breeding harmful obsessions and anxiety.

### The Physical Impact

The consequences of trauma extend well beyond emotional distress. Many survivors, myself included, experience it somatically: disrupted sleep, loss of appetite, and general malaise. The deep, pervasive nature of these symptoms underscores the severity of our collective experience and calls for understanding and support.

## Experiencing the Shock First-Hand

![Person startled at a desk as a sudden explosion shakes the room, objects falling around them.](https://oaidalleapiprodscus.blob.core.windows.net/private/org-5JJ8aWH7HYWySPOfcWeXFaip/user-yP0O54fRxuFGq1kcxDqpfG1J/img-bDzfp0dTrZq9C1S6QKubLPGy.png?st=2025-05-08T02%3A28%3A53Z&se=2025-05-08T04%3A28%3A53Z&sp=r&sv=2024-08-04&sr=b&rscd=inline&rsct=image/png&skoid=cc612491-d948-4d2e-9821-2683df3719f5&sktid=a48cca56-e6da-484e-a814-9c849652bcb3&skt=2025-05-07T22%3A01%3A30Z&ske=2025-05-08T22%3A01%3A30Z&sks=b&skv=2024-08-04&sig=0DiG7O3ugXnsj3m0RPXHI3c%2BIhJ/LNDcDfohWggkKeQ%3D)


### The Moment of the Explosion

When the catastrophic event occurred, I was in the midst of an online conversation. Suddenly, the ground began to tremble, and in that instant, life was abruptly interrupted. The person I was speaking with immediately disconnected, undoubtedly to check on loved ones and assess the situation.

### Disrupted Lives

The blast not only caused physical destruction but also interrupted daily routines and relationships. Even long-standing plans were instantly replaced by crisis response and a search for meaning amidst chaos.

### National Guilt and Shame

Feelings of guilt and shame extend beyond personal survival to a more communal sense of despair for Lebanon. Understanding the decisions that led to the storage of hazardous materials near residential districts remains an enigma, and it is difficult not to feel ashamed for the mismanagement and negligence that precipitated this tragedy.

### Comparison to Other Tragedies

While the Beirut explosion was devastating, 2020 had already been a year rife with catastrophes, most notably the global COVID-19 pandemic, which had claimed hundreds of thousands of lives by the time of this writing. The cumulative effect of these events has created a lingering sense of uncertainty and sorrow for so many around the world.

## The Erosion of Place and Memory

![A destroyed Beirut neighborhood after the explosion, with rubble and damaged buildings in view.](https://oaidalleapiprodscus.blob.core.windows.net/private/org-5JJ8aWH7HYWySPOfcWeXFaip/user-yP0O54fRxuFGq1kcxDqpfG1J/img-799p7yE8N3kkEJ2m48O7riJi.png?st=2025-05-08T02%3A29%3A14Z&se=2025-05-08T04%3A29%3A14Z&sp=r&sv=2024-08-04&sr=b&rscd=inline&rsct=image/png&skoid=cc612491-d948-4d2e-9821-2683df3719f5&sktid=a48cca56-e6da-484e-a814-9c849652bcb3&skt=2025-05-07T22%3A27%3A15Z&ske=2025-05-08T22%3A27%3A15Z&sks=b&skv=2024-08-04&sig=DvlJRrW44SlK%2BF7GV5jsxkCysIqTLhceenRb7RBrUwg%3D)


### The Coup de Grâce for Lebanon

The explosion in Beirut symbolized, for many, the final blow in a series of crises afflicting Lebanon. The country was already reeling from political upheaval, currency devaluation, and limited access to financial resources due to banking restrictions. In this context, the blast seemed an almost insurmountable setback.

### Psychological Aftershocks

The collective trauma has lasting implications for memory and mental health. The overwhelming nature of these events may result in persistent memory problems, as the brain struggles to process repeated, intense stress. Many, myself included, write and speak today with deep pain that words alone cannot convey.

### Searching for Accountability

A natural response to such a profound event is to seek answers: Who is responsible? Who benefits from such tragedy? These questions may never be fully resolved, yet they are vital for the community’s attempt at healing and justice.

### The Persistence of Pain

As time passes, the trauma does not simply fade away. The mind, often playing tricks, cycles between grief and fleeting hope. Even mundane connections, such as the rhyme between “brain,” “rain,” and “pain,” take on symbolic significance, pointing to the persistence of sorrow — or, perhaps, the inevitability of renewal after loss.

### Conclusion: Reflecting on a Year of Danger

The year 2020 will enter the annals of history as a year marked by danger and distress, fundamentally altering memories and experiences for countless individuals. It is difficult to understand how a vibrant, promising place like Lebanon could undergo such profound adversity. Yet, through reflection, writing, and collective action, there remains hope that healing, though slow, will eventually arrive.
