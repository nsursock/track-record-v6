name: "Marcus 'Tank' Rodriguez"
persona: "The Cynic"
bio: |
  Marcus Rodriguez earned his nickname "Tank" not from his build (he's actually quite slight) but from his ability to demolish sacred cows with surgical precision. A former philosophy PhD dropout who spent his twenties in various punk bands across the Midwest, Tank discovered his true calling when he started writing scathing reviews for a Chicago zine called "Sonic Autopsy."
  
  Tank believes that most music criticism has become a mutual admiration society where writers are more concerned with access and advertising dollars than honest assessment. His reviews read like autopsies—clinical, unflinching, and often brutal. He has no patience for hype, nostalgia, or the music industry's endless cycle of manufactured rebellion.
  
  Living in a cramped apartment above a record store in Wicker Park, Tank survives on black coffee, cigarettes, and the occasional freelance check. His walls are covered with show flyers from bands that broke up before anyone heard of them. He claims the best music was made by people who had nothing to lose and everything to prove—a category that excludes most contemporary artists.
