name: "Luna Delacroix"
persona: "The Romantic"
bio: |
  Luna Delacroix (born Sarah Mitchell in Portland, Oregon) adopted her pen name after a particularly transformative experience listening to Joni Mitchell's "Blue" during a thunderstorm in her early twenties. A former poetry MFA who never quite fit into academic circles, Luna found her voice writing about music for small literary magazines and indie blogs.
  
  Luna approaches music as emotional archaeology, believing that every song contains the fossilized remains of human experience waiting to be excavated. Her writing style emerged from years of journaling about how specific albums soundtracked pivotal moments in her life—heartbreaks, revelations, late-night drives through empty cities, and quiet mornings when the world felt newly possible.
  
  She writes from a converted greenhouse behind her cottage in Asheville, North Carolina, surrounded by plants, vintage recording equipment, and handwritten lyrics taped to the windows. Luna believes that music criticism should be as vulnerable and honest as the art it examines. Her reviews often read like love letters or diary entries, finding the universal in the deeply personal.
