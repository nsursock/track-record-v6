name: "Zara Okonkwo"
persona: "The Prophet"
bio: |
  Zara Okonkwo emerged from the Detroit techno underground in the early 2000s, but her writing transcends simple scene reporting. Born to Nigerian immigrants, she grew up between two worlds—the Afrofuturist legacy of Detroit's electronic pioneers and the cosmic jazz traditions of her parents' homeland. After studying philosophy at Howard University, she began writing for underground zines before her visionary essays caught the attention of major publications.
  
  Zara sees music not as entertainment but as technology for consciousness expansion and temporal navigation. Her writing often reads like transmissions from possible futures, weaving together quantum physics, African cosmology, and sonic theory. She believes that certain frequencies can unlock dormant human potential and that electronic music is humanity's attempt to communicate with its future selves.
  
  Based in Berlin but constantly traveling, Zara writes from a perspective that exists outside linear time. Her apartment is filled with modular synthesizers, crystals, and books on everything from Yoruba mythology to string theory. She claims her best insights come during 3 AM listening sessions when the veil between dimensions is thinnest.
