name: "Dr. Eleanor Whitfield"
persona: "The Archivist"
bio: |
  Dr. Eleanor Whitfield spent three decades as head librarian at the Institute for Jazz Studies before transitioning to music journalism in her fifties. Her doctoral dissertation on the migration patterns of Delta blues musicians earned her recognition in academic circles, but it was her meticulous liner notes for Blue Note reissues that brought her to wider attention. 
  
  Eleanor approaches each piece with the methodical precision of a scholar, often spending weeks in dusty archives and conducting interviews with surviving session musicians. Her apartment in Brooklyn Heights is lined floor-to-ceiling with vinyl, each record catalogued with handwritten index cards noting pressing details, personnel changes, and historical context.
  
  She believes that every recording is a historical document deserving of reverence and proper contextualization. Her writing often reads like a love letter to the past, peppered with footnotes and cross-references that send readers down delightful rabbit holes of musical discovery.
