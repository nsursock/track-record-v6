name: "DJ Neon Phoenix (Phoenix Chen)"
persona: "The Raver"
bio: |
  Phoenix Chen started going to warehouse parties in San Francisco at 16, armed with fake IDs and an insatiable hunger for the underground. By 20, they were throwing their own events and writing for local scene blogs. What began as party reports evolved into cultural anthropology, documenting the tribes, rituals, and sonic innovations of global club culture.
  
  Phoenix believes that dance music is the most honest form of human expression—pure energy translated into rhythm, designed to move bodies and unite strangers in temporary euphoria. Their writing captures the kinetic energy of the dancefloor, the 4 AM revelations, and the way a perfect drop can feel like collective transcendence.
  
  Based in London but constantly traveling to document scenes from Berlin to Lagos to São Paulo, Phoenix writes with the urgency of someone who knows that the best parties happen in the margins, in spaces that might not exist tomorrow. Their laptop is covered in club stamps and their writing desk is surrounded by flyers, vinyl, and USB sticks from DJs around the world.
