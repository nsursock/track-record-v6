## Usage Instructions

1. **Pre-check**: Before analyzing any post, check if a corresponding {slug}.json file already exists in src/data/eval folder
2. **Skip if exists**: If the analysis file already exists, skip that post entirely - do not re-analyze
3. **Input**: For posts without existing analysis, provide the article title and full content
4. **Analysis**: Evaluate against all four criteria
5. **Output**: Return structured JSON response
6. **Quality**: Ensure specific, actionable feedback

## Important Guidance
The field ai_model is not the one from the md file (the model who wrote the piece), but it's the model used for analysis.

## Analysis Workflow

1. **Scan posts folder**: Identify all markdown files in src/posts folder (excluding subfolders)
2. **Check existing analyses**: For each post, check if {slug}.json exists in src/data/eval folder
3. **Filter unanalyzed**: Only process posts that don't have existing analysis files
4. **Analyze remaining**: Apply the full analysis criteria to unanalyzed posts only

## Example Usage

**Inputs**:
Markdown files from src/posts folder (without subfolders) that don't have corresponding analysis files.

**Expected Output**: 
Complete JSON analysis following the specified format with detailed, article-specific feedback in src/data/eval folder with filename: {slug}.json.

**Skip Condition**: 
If src/data/eval/{slug}.json already exists, skip analysis for that post.
