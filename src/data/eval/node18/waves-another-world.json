  "overall_rating": 2.9,
  "overall_assessment": "This piece attempts an ambitious exploration of cosmic perspective, personal loss, and the search for meaning through music and space. While the author's willingness to blend deeply personal trauma with philosophical reflection on humanity's place in the universe is compelling, the execution suffers from scattered focus and unclear connections between themes. The writing would benefit from a stronger organizing principle to unite the various elements into a coherent narrative that serves both the cosmic and intimate dimensions of the human experience."
