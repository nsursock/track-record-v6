  "overall_rating": 3.1,
  "overall_assessment": "This piece offers a raw, personal exploration of social dynamics through the lens of trauma and misunderstanding. While the author's vulnerability and unique perspective on human behavior are compelling, the writing suffers from unclear structure and disconnected thoughts that make it difficult to follow. The central theme of people wanting to 'shine' and creating victims in the process has potential, but needs more development and clearer articulation to reach its full impact."
