  "overall_rating": 3.2,
  "overall_assessment": "This piece offers a refreshingly critical perspective on motivational speaking and aggressive sales culture, using Jordan Belfort as a case study for questionable business ethics. The author's skeptical stance and personal insights create an engaging counter-narrative to typical business advice. However, the writing suffers from unclear structure and confusing passages that weaken the impact of otherwise valid criticisms. The piece would benefit from more organized argumentation and clearer articulation of alternative approaches to ethical business practices."
