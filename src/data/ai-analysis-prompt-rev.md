## Guidelines

### Scoring Scale
- **5.0**: Exceptional, professional-grade quality
- **4.0**: High quality with minor areas for improvement
- **3.0**: Good baseline with notable room for enhancement
- **2.0**: Below average, needs significant improvement
- **1.0**: Poor quality, requires major revision

### Strengths & Suggestions
- Provide 2-3 specific, actionable strengths for each criterion
- Offer 2-3 concrete, constructive suggestions for improvement
- Focus on specific examples rather than generic feedback
- Balance encouragement with honest assessment

### Improvement Notes
- Highlight specific improvements made in this revision
- Compare to previous version when possible
- Note both successful changes and missed opportunities

### Overall Assessment & Revision Summary
- Write 2-3 sentences summarizing the revised article's impact
- Highlight the most significant strengths and improvements
- Identify priority areas for future revisions
- Maintain constructive, professional tone

## Usage Instructions

1. **Pre-check**: Before analyzing any revised post, check what revision files already exist in src/data/eval folder
2. **Determine revision number**: Look for existing {slug}.json, {slug}.rev1.json, {slug}.rev2.json, etc. to determine the next revision number
3. **Skip if current revision exists**: If the analysis file for this revision already exists, skip that post entirely
4. **Input**: For posts needing revision analysis, provide the article title and full revised content
5. **Analysis**: Evaluate against all four criteria, noting improvements from previous versions
6. **Output**: Return structured JSON response with revision tracking
7. **Quality**: Ensure specific, actionable feedback with improvement tracking

## Important Guidance
- The field ai_model is the model used for this analysis (not the model that wrote the article)
- The revision_number field should reflect which revision this is (1 for first revision, 2 for second, etc.)
- Always include improvement_notes to track progress across revisions
- Compare against previous analysis when possible to note improvements

## Revision Analysis Workflow

1. **Scan posts folder**: Identify all markdown files in src/posts folder (excluding subfolders)
2. **Check revision status**: For each post, check what analysis files exist:
   - {slug}.json (original analysis)
   - {slug}.rev1.json (first revision analysis)
   - {slug}.rev2.json (second revision analysis)
   - etc.
3. **Determine next revision**: Identify which revision number should be analyzed next
4. **Filter unanalyzed revisions**: Only process revised posts that don't have analysis for their current revision
5. **Analyze revisions**: Apply the full analysis criteria to unanalyzed revised posts only

## Example Usage

**Inputs**:
Revised markdown files from src/posts folder that have been updated since their last analysis.
Here is the list (only one article to analyze): victim-foolish

**Expected Output**: 
Complete JSON analysis following the specified format with detailed, revision-specific feedback in src/data/eval folder with filename: {slug}.rev{N}.json where N is the revision number.

**Skip Condition**: 
If src/data/eval/{slug}.rev{N}.json already exists for the current revision, skip analysis for that post.
